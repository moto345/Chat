create a physics simulation in java script of container full of gas molecules. The molecules should be simple, diatomic helium gas molecules.  Also in addition to collision physics also add  corrections for van der wals forces and apply distortion to the mechanism of the molecules based on these forces

create a simple 2D demonstration of the above in javascript to the level of complexity that you can code

using the mass of the helium nucleus and the speeds of the gas molecules have label that output the temperature of the box at any instant. Use statistical mechanics to calculate the temperature

update above code to add the label in html below the gas container To the right of the gas container have a small box that explains the kinetic theory of gases and have the relevant equation below it
